# About
TAB aims to be a superior all-in-one minecraft plugin for displaying information that outperforms all 
similar plugins in terms of features, performance, compatibility and support.  
More information can be found at [Why TAB?](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Why-TAB%3F) wiki page.

# Distribution
As of TAB 3.0.0, released with MC 1.18 (November 30th, 2021), there is no free / premium
version anymore. Only one version of the plugin exists now, which contains all implemented features
and is available to everyone for free. However, official support on discord is only provided to 
those who have purchased the plugin.  

# Compiling
Compilation requires JDK 8 and up.  
To compile the plugin, run `./gradlew build` from the terminal.  
Once the plugin compiles, grab the jar from `/jar/build/libs/` folder.

# Links
The precompiled JAR can be downloaded for free from 
[github releases](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/releases)
and [MC-Market](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/20631/).  
  
If you want to show your appreciation for my work, you can purchase the plugin on 
[MC-Market](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/14009/),
[Polymart](https://polymart.org/resource/484) or just [send a donation](https://paypal.me/neznamy1).
  
Support is provided to buyers on [discord](https://discord.gg/EaSvdk6).  

A detailed explanation of all the plugin's functions can be found on the 
[wiki](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki).

# Issues
The [Issues](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/issues) section is **only** available for **bug reports**
or other issues which are not directly a bug (performance issues, errors, etc.).
Support is provided on discord and feature requests are currently not accepted due to high demand and
being busy with bug reports, which take priority over new features. 
We are not looking to add any new major features anymore. 
We would rather spend time improving existing features instead.  
  
When opening a bug report, make sure you provide all necessary information to reproduce the bug,
otherwise we will not able to fix it. Saying "it only occurs randomly" or "I don't know how to 
reproduce it" has no value and cannot be converted into actual code.
